,"  The shares of FAANG name Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are inching higher today, last seen up 0.4% at $145.45. Boasting a 22% year-over-year lead, AAPL's Sept. 7 all-time of $157.26 so far marks the pinnacle of the stock's stellar year. However, in the month and a half following that peak, the equity has shed 7.5%, and now faces pressure from the previously supportive 80-day moving average. This pullback has done little to deter option bulls. In fact, the security landed in second place on Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White's list of stocks that have attracted the highest weekly options volume within the last two weeks, with new names to the list highlighted in yellow. According to White, 1,635,513 calls and 837,776 puts were exchanged over this two week time period. The most popular position was the October 145 call, followed by the 144 call in the same series. This preference for bullish bets is being echoed in today's trading. So far, 376,000 calls have crossed the tape, compared to 174,000 puts. The weekly 10/22 145-, 146-, and 144-strike calls take up the top three spots for most popular contracts today, with new positions being bought to open at each. This suggests traders are expecting more upside for AAPL by the time these positions expire this Friday. Despite this preference for calls, puts have been unusually popular. At the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), AAPL's 50-day put/call volume ratio stands higher than 84% of readings from the past year. This means long puts have been picked up a much quicker clip during the past two weeks. Now could be a good opportunity to take advantage of Apple stock's next move with options. The security's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 22% sits in the 14th percentile of its annual range, indicating that options traders are pricing in relatively low volatility expectations at the moment. Plus, the stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) comes in at a relatively high 71 (out of 100). In other words, the security has exceeded options traders' volatility expectations in the last year."
Yahoo Finance,"  When close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or ""P/E's"") below 17x, you may consider Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 29.7x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason, and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified. Before we start, investors should know that Apple has an outstanding performance in multiple areas, such as cash flows, working capital management, earnings quality, and especially returns. You can view our detailed report on Apple in order to get a clear picture of the company's fundamentals. You can also read what qualitative factors are impacting Apple's growth here. Today, will go over the fundamentals of Apple, and see why some investors might like the stock even at a more expensive valuation. Of course, buying a stock at ""any"" price is slowly building a house of cards, and investors might want to be more patient with their stock picks. With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Apple has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.  See our latest analysis for Apple  The chart above shows us that the company is valued more expensively than both the market and sector. While the P/E is not preposterous, it might be worth thinking if investor's enthusiasm is justified. One thing that can help investors with having a clearer picture of a company's future, is to think of a few possible events that can boost and a few that can weaken the stock. For example, one great catalyst might be the global chip shortage, which will translate in stronger profits for Apple. A negative catalyst might be the recent settlement in the app store related court case. Investors may also be keen to find out how analysts think Apple's future stacks up against the industry, and can take a look at our free report. Apple's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market. If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 55%. The latest three-year period has also seen an excellent 85% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 6.0% each year, as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 12% per year, which is noticeably more attractive. With this information, we find it concerning that Apple is trading at a P/E higher than the market. Investors sometimes conflate the love for the company with the future performance of the stock. If we want the best outcome on the market, we must know what is happening to the stock with the cash flows as a foundational basis for our analysis. In the chart below, there is an important point investors might consider. We compared the sales and three measures of profit to market valuations. In a healthy market environment, investors can expect that the market adjusts for growth appropriately, and a graph like this would yield relatively consistent horizontal lines. What we will notice, however, is that after 2018 the market has been less strict with Apple's profits. The pricing of revenue has also deviated, but one can argue that sales growth has been keeping up more with the stock, then earnings growth. We can also notice, that the market periodically corrects for this. And the more we veer into the future the more volatile the corrections become. Investors should keep this in mind, and consider that if interested in buying Apple stock, holding it for the long term, might be a better strategy to avoid some volatility. Apple stock is currently more expensive than the market and sector. Revenue growth seems to be keeping up with the stock price, however, the company cannot reach the necessary profit growth rates to keep up with the historical benchmark. To be clear, Apple's growth is still high, but the market seems to be less demanding for cash flows. Apple is still a solid company with impeccable performance, however the stock is starting to show signs of future short term volatility, and investors may consider longer strategies to offset this. Alternatively, one can try timing the stock, as it does seem to correct periodically. - This is a risky approach, and investors might not realize potential gains like if they have just entered a position sooner or have a consistent investing scheme.

Yahoo Finance,"  Investors who have owned stocks in the last year have generally experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) total return over the last 12 months is 61.9%. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way. Apple’s Big Run: One company that has been a good investment in the last year has been iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Apple recently unveiled its family of iPhone 12 models, which are the first to be compatible with 5G mobile networks. Analysts are expecting 5G iPhones to trigger yet another massive global upgrade cycle among existing iPhone users. When iPhone sales growth began to slow in recent years, Apple made a massive pivot to a recurring services model, a transition that is ongoing to this day. As of the fiscal first quarter of 2021, Apple said it now has a massive installed user base of more than 1.65 billion active devices. Apple’s Services segment is all about further monetizing that user base, and services revenue generates an impressive gross profit margin of about 68%. See also: How To Buy Apple Stock Fortunately for Apple investors, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 didn’t negatively impact its business much at all. In fact, the iPhone 12 helped generate 5.5% revenue growth for Apple in fiscal 2020. Net profit was also up 3.9% to $57.4 billion on the year. At the beginning of 2020, Apple shares were trading at around $296. By the beginning of March, the stock was down to $282 after news of the coronavirus spreading in China prompting concerns about a U.S. pandemic. Apple ultimately bottomed at $212.61 during the pandemic-driven March sell-off. Fortunately for Apple investors, the dip did not last long. By June, Apple shares were back at new all-time highs above $330 and was as high as $514.14 in August prior to a four-to-one stock split. Related Link: If You Invested ,000 In Ford Stock One Year Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Now  Apple In 2021, Beyond: The stock eventually made it back up to new split-adjusted highs of $145.09 in January 2021. In recent days, the stock has pulled back from its highs, settling back down to $120. Still, Apple investors who bought one year ago and held on have generated a big return on their investment. In fact, $1,000 in Apple stock bought on March 26, 2020, would be worth about $1,968 today, assuming reinvested dividends. Looking ahead, analysts are expecting even more upside for Apple in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 37 analysts covering the stock is $155, suggesting a 28.5% upside from current levels.

Yahoo Finance,"  Citigroup (NYSE:C) analyst Jim Suva predicts that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could announce an $80 billion to $90 billion buyback and increase its dividend by 5% to 10%. In turn, AAPL stock opened at $168.02 after closing at $165.75 Monday evening, and now sits at a little more than $167 per share. However, the Apple dividend increase and buyback potential could have AAPL stock rising before and after its next earnings report — scheduled for April 28. Of course, Apple is not new to share repurchases. Apple spent $85.5 billion on buying stock and $14.5 billion on dividends in its most recent fiscal year, which ended in September of last year. However, this is just the first step in their plan to grow and evolve. Most tech giants, including Apple, are cash cows. Apple has a lot of cash sitting in its coffers right now. In fact, their total cash hoards are at $202.6 billion, and they’ve got investments piling up by the minute. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Furthermore, Citibank analysts say that Apple’s stock is undervalued and not considering the company’s potential. Jim Suva said the company is releasing some really exciting gadgets in the future, particularly augmented-reality/virtual-reality headsets and a new Apple car. However, shares aren’t reflecting this right now. In addition, Apple stock and the other major indices were buoyant after a report indicated that core inflation increased less than expected in March. 7 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy for April 2022 According to evidence from the U.S. Labor Department, prices for everyday items kept increasing in March to their highest levels since the late 1980s. However, inflation data showed that the month-to-month growth was less than expected. Overall, Apple is a great company that has been consistently innovating and improving its products. In turn, the share price of AAPL stock keeps going up and the shares are becoming more valuable every day. The firm innovates quickly and continues to grow with the times to stay competitive against other tech-based businesses. Moreover, despite the worldwide supply chain issues, Apple was able to power through. Despite parts shortages, Apple shattered its revenue record, sales upped 11% to $124 billion, and profit grew from $28.7 billion to $34.6 billion. With that in mind, Apple has made a habit of outshining analyst estimates. The company sets the pace for innovation and beats competitors in virtually every measure. Thus, based on the company’s current trends and future promises, AAPL stock could be worth a lot in the future. However, timing is everything when it comes to Apple. The next catalyst coming up for the tech giant is its second-quarter results, scheduled for after the closing bell on April 28.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockRover.com That said, according to one analysis, when Apple posts a better-than-expected earnings report, the stock usually drops by almost 1% the next day. When earnings are reported, a pop tends to happen. After that, however, there is a dip and then an eventual runup to the next earnings report. You can understand the trend by looking at the accompanying chart, which shows a similar performance pattern, with squares denoting earnings. So, collectively, AAPL stock has all the ingredients to provide another exceptional earnings report. Therefore, you should invest in AAPL now as it gears up for its upcoming earnings release.

Yahoo Finance,"  By Sinéad Carew and Farah Master (Reuters) - Shares in U.S. casinos with operations in Macau fell on Tuesday, with Las Vegas Sands Corp down 12.3% and Wynn Resorts Ltd down 12.4% on concerns about stiffer regulations there and a COVID-19 outbreak. China's health authorities said new COVID-19 infections more than doubled in the southeastern Fujian province, prompting officials to roll out measures that include travel restrictions to halt the spread of the virus. Also, the Macau government said on Tuesday it was kicking off a 45-day public consultation https://www.gov.mo/zh-hans/news/556115 to review the gaming industry, including issues such as the number and duration of casino licenses as well as supervision requirements. Las Vegas Sands' shares dropped to $37.12, their lowest level since Aug. 20, while Wynn hit a low of $90.42, a level not touched since Aug. 23. MGM Resorts International shares were down 4.5% at $41.15. ""Fujian is hopefully transitory. The supervision continues ongoing efforts and shouldn’t be to surprising,"" said Morningstar analyst Dan Wasiolek. But he noted that ""in the current environment of China increasing oversight on technology companies, investors in Macau are a bit on edge today."" Beijing has been engaged in a broad regulatory crackdown that has ensnared sectors ranging from technology to education and property and wiped billions of dollars off the market value of some of the country's largest companies. U.S. shares of Melco Resorts and Entertainment Ltd were down 7.2% at $11.79.

"Two stocks on the market’s ‘naughty list’ could be set for a 2022 comeback, traders say","  In this article The stock market is tracking for another year of double-digit percentage gains, but some players have not joined in on the fun. Peloton, Zoom Video, Penn National Gaming and Global Payments are among the stocks that have been relegated to Santa's 'naughty list,' not just sitting out the rally but also posting steep losses for the year. CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" asked two of its traders which of the most beaten-down stocks could be setting up to rebound in the new year. Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments, highlighted payments company Block, the company formerly known as Square. Shares have tumbled 23% this year. ""This is a company that is in the perfect space for disruption, but they seem to have faced a number of hurdles this year, not just recent regulatory concerns about 'Buy Now, Pay Later,' but there were worries about slowdowns in payments and as fiscal 'stimmy' checks began to fade,"" Tengler said on Thursday. The tailwinds for 2022 are now piling up, she says. An e-commerce partnership with TikTok and its acquisition of 'Buy Now, Pay Later' company Afterpay are two reasons to be bullish, according to Tengler. Joule Financial president Quint Tatro instead is focusing on casino stock Las Vegas Sands, which is down more than 35% this year. ""Las Vegas Sands has really experienced a double whammy this year. Obviously, it's an entertainment name that's going to be in trouble due to Covid, but it's also tied to China. So this stock has really been in the trash heap,"" Tatro said during the same interview. Chinese stocks and companies with exposure to the country have had a bumpy 2021 as Beijing cracked down on certain industries ranging from tech to private education amid the nation's uneven economic recovery. Las Vegas Sands generates nearly half of its revenue from Macao, a gambling destination off the coast of mainland China. ""I do think travel and gaming will come back,"" said Tatro. ""This is a stock that looks fairly cheap, has been beaten up, but I think will do well in the coming years."" Disclosure: Laffer Tengler Investments holds SQ. Joule Financial holds LVS.

Yahoo Finance,"  In this article, we will take a look at the 10 best Las Vegas stocks to buy now. You can skip our comprehensive analysis of these companies and go directly to the 5 Best Las Vegas Stocks to Buy Now. The casino and gambling industry had suffered under COVID-19 as social distancing, remote working, and the suspension of commercial activities forced luxury resorts and gaming establishments to close their doors for business in early 2020. However, at the turn of the year, the economy seemed to be reopening, and there was a flurry of activity as the vaccine rollout allowed Las Vegas to welcome back tourists in limited numbers once again. On April 29, the Mississippi government even removed mask requirements for people at casinos.  The industry, which stood at $470 billion in 2020, is expected to grow to $520 billion this year at a compound annual growth rate of close to 11%. Major players in the industry are expected to lead this growth. MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM), one of the largest gaming companies in Las Vegas, reported quarterly revenues of $1.65 billion earlier this month, beating market estimates by $80 million. MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) also reported earnings per share of -$0.68, narrowing losses and beating analyst predictions by $0.19.  It is not only the casino and hotel industry that will benefit from the upward trend in the gambling world. The firms who supply casino owners with the equipment they need to run the establishments are also set to register gains. Scientific Games Corporation (NASDAQ: SGMS), a gaming equipment manufacturer, is looking to capitalize on the digital trends of the pandemic and recently signed a cross-licensing agreement with a rival for cashless slot machines. Scientific Games Corporation (NASDAQ: SGMS) aims to market these slots to several casinos. Established gaming firms like Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE: LVS) have also been making steady gains as the government gradually allows 100% capacity at hotels and casinos. In Clark County, casinos will be able to operate at 80% starting next month and fully once the vaccination rate in their area reaches 60%. Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE: LVS) has plans to expand in Texas as international revenue takes a hit due to the slow vaccine rollout in Asia. However, with China in the midst of mass vaccination drives, Macau is slowly recovering too. Another notable stock to benefit from the upcoming recovery in the gaming sector is Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ: WYNN). Recently, investment firm Argus upgraded the stock, citing a strong recovery in Las Vegas and the company’s upbeat operations in Boston. The firm also likes Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ: WYNN)'s prospects in Macau, where it is investing in premium mass and luxury markets. The firm also noted that this casino company has launched iGaming/sports betting platform in 10 states. Argus has a price target of $50 for Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN). Some emerging trends in the industry for the new year include the impact of cryptocurrencies on the gambling industry, changing consumer habits with the rise in use of mobile phones and digital applications to satisfy gambling needs, and the shift to virtual reality-based gaming products around the world. Casinos will have to navigate these challenges deftly in order to recover from pandemic-related losses while holding on to their market shares. Land-based casinos can learn several lessons about industry disruption by observing hedge funds. The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape.

"Two beaten-down gambling stocks could be poised to rebound, traders say","  In this article Casino stocks are on a hot streak this week. Las Vegas Sands, Wynn, Caesars, Penn National Gaming and MGM Resorts have all surged in recent days, getting a big boost Tuesday after gambling destination Macao eased restrictions for visitors from mainland China. This group has been incredibly volatile over the past 18 months, hit hard by closures and then travel disruptions and uneven traffic during the coronavirus pandemic. So, is Lady Luck finally on the casinos' side? Quint Tatro, president of Joule Financial, says yes … for one stock. ""The easy play is Las Vegas Sands,"" Tatro told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Tuesday. ""It was March of just this year we were on here speaking about their abrupt shift and their sale of all their Las Vegas properties to basically double down and focus on their Asia exposure. At the time, I think it was a big question mark."" The benefits of that strategy now make more sense to Tatro in light of China's reopening and Macao's rebound. Las Vegas Sands announced in the first quarter that it would sell its Vegas properties including its Venetian Resort for a total of $6.25 billion. ""It still has a difficult balance sheet, it's not the greatest balance sheet, but they do have $2 billion now in unrestricted cash that they can put where they see the best opportunity,"" said Tatro. ""If this [rebound] is legit and we start to see a resurgence in the casino space, I think Las Vegas Sands is the play here."" Las Vegas Sands has tumbled 36% from a March high. It is down 28% for the year. JC O'Hara, chief market technician at MKM Partners, said the downturn in the China-exposed casino names has him wary. Instead, he prefers DraftKings, a gambling stock that he says looks to have stabilized after its pullback. ""It is reestablishing itself in an uptrend, breaking back above the 150-day moving average. So rather than trying to bottom pick some of these names and make calls on economic data, let's look where the price action is positive and that's DraftKings,"" he said during the same interview. O'Hara targets the March highs above $74 as a promising target price and sees a band of support at $50. DraftKings closed Tuesday at $56.47. Disclaimer In this article © 2024 CNBC LLC.

"Las Vegas Sands Leaving The Strip With Sale of Venetian Hotel, Expo Center","  AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images  The Las Vegas Sands Corp. is selling its signature hotel, The Venetian Resort Las Vegas, and leaving the Strip. Las Vegas Sands Corp. is selling the hotel along with the Sands Expo and Convention Center for about $6.25 billion, the company announced this week. Robert Goldstein, the group's chairman and chief executive officer, said while the Venetian ""changed the face of future casino development,"" the company now plans to shift its focus to its properties in Asia, including the famed Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. ""This company is focused on growth, and we see meaningful opportunities on a variety of fronts,"" Goldstein said in a statement. ""Asia remains the backbone of this company and our developments in Macao and Singapore are the center of our attention. We will always look for ways to reinvest in our properties and those communities. There are also potential development opportunities domestically, where we believe significant capital investment will provide a substantial benefit to those jurisdictions while also producing very strong returns for the company."" The name of the Venetian, the expo center as well as the Palazzo, will remain, and the company's headquarters will stay in Las Vegas, according to The Associated Press. 6236475791001 The Venetian was first completed in 1999 by Sheldon Adelson — who died earlier this year — as a tribute to the city he visited on his honeymoon, according to the hotel, featuring baroque-­inspired murals and gondola rides on canals that snaked their way through the hotel. ""Sheldon Adelson changed the Las Vegas market with his emphasis on conventions. He put a premium on that,"" University of Nevada, Las Vegas history professor Michael Green told the wire service. The hotel will be purchased by VICI Properties while Apollo Global Management will earn the operations rights. ""As we announce the sale of The Venetian Resort, we pay tribute to Mr. Adelson's legacy while starting a new chapter in this company's history,"" Goldstein said. Las Vegas has struggled amid the coronavirus pandemic, with the Las Vegas Sands posting a quarterly loss of almost $300 million in January, The AP reported. But there's hope for Sin City: Last month, MGM Resorts in Las Vegas (including the Mandalay Bay, Park MGM, and The Mirage resorts) said it would resume 24/7 hotel operations after temporarily closing mid-week due to a decreased demand.

Yahoo Finance,"  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE: LVS) is selling the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center for approximately $6.25 billion. What Happened: The divestiture is divided between two entities: VICI Properties will acquire the property and all associated assets for $4 billion, while Apollo Global Management (NYSE: APO) purchased the operations of the Venetian for $2.25 billion. The Venetian opened in 1999 under the ownership of Sheldon Adelson, a co-founder of the COMDEX tech industry trade show. The property cost $1.5 billion to construct, a record for its time, and was built on the site of the Sands Hotel and Casino, which gained pop culture immortality for hosting the Rat Pack concerts in 1960. The Sands Expo and Convention Center opened in 1990 behind the Sands Hotel. At the time of its opening, it was the second largest convention center in the world and the only privately owned and operated U.S. convention center. Why It Happened: Adelson died Jan. 21. Las Vegas Sands Chairman and CEO Robert Goldstein said the transaction signals a new focus on markets outside of Nevada’s gambling capital. “As we announce the sale of The Venetian Resort, we pay tribute to Mr. Adelson's legacy while starting a new chapter in this company's history,"" said Goldstein. “This company is focused on growth, and we see meaningful opportunities on a variety of fronts: Asia remains the backbone of this company and our developments in Macao and Singapore are the center of our attention.” Goldstein added that while the company will consider reinvestments in its existing properties, he also highlighted “potential development opportunities domestically where we believe significant capital investment will provide a substantial benefit to those jurisdictions while also producing very strong returns for the company.” LVS Price Action: Las Vegas Sands shares were up 1.2% at $65.72 at last check Wednesday.

The cosmetics industry encompasses companies that manufacture, sell, and market beauty products like makeup, shampoos, lotions, fragrances, creams, etc. It is undoubtedly one of the fastest-growing industries in the world, generating over $500 billion in sales in 2020. This has certainly made the cosmetic stocks gain value and grab the attention of investors around the globe.  The dawn of 2020 brought uncertainties in every aspect of life and the cosmetic industry is no exception. According to National Purchase Diary NPD, during the first half of 2020, the sales of makeup products, especially lipsticks, declined by 24% due to the constant use of facemasks.

Yahoo Finance,"  If you have seen makeup out-of-stocks at your local CVS, Target or Walmart recently then you probably aren't alone, as easing mask mandates in the U.S. send folks back out looking their best at parties, work or other public events. And the hard data is starting to reflect that shift back to some form of normal, non mask-wearing mobility among humans. Cosmetics sales for the four-weeks ended May 22 have surged 16.7% from a year ago, according to the latest data out of Nielsen. Sales of cosmetics over a 12-week stretch are up 24.7% from last year. The cosmetics segment has seen the fastest sales growth these past three months out of the beauty care categories tracked by Nielsen. In second place is a 15.5% growth rate for fragrance sales. Meanwhile, cosmetics seller Ulta Beauty said last week that first quarter same-store sales rose 7% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2019. A year ago, most of Ulta's stores were closed as the pandemic took hold. E.L.F. Beauty — which sells its affordable cosmetics down the aisles of Target and Walmart — saw its first quarter sales pop 24% year-over-year. ""The performance that we've had for a while, pre-pandemic on prestige [cosmetics], it's been challenging, but so many of our brand partners have reacted with strong innovation, strong product innovation, new marketing approaches through social media. And as customers come back in, as our guests come back in, we're anticipating that part of our business really strengthening over the balance of the year,"" new Ulta CEO Dave Kimbell told analysts on an earnings call. There appears to be several big makeup brand winners emerging. L'Oreal's Maybelline brand has seen sales spike 28% over the past four weeks. Coty-owned Cover Girl's sales are up 21% during that same timespan. ""Those sales are going to spike,"" pointed out Refinitiv retail analyst Jharonne Martis on the outlook for cosmetics sales on Yahoo Finance Live. To be sure, several of the makeup stocks have begun to catch a bid in the anticipation of a strong second half of profits. Shares of Coty and E.L.F. are up 12% and 6%, respectively in the past three months. Ulta shares have stayed relatively unchanged. Revlon is up 26%. Jefferies retail analyst Stephanie Wissink — who closely tracks the cosmetics industry — believes E.L.F. and Coty are two of the better plays on the makeup recovery. Wissink rates both stocks at a Buy rating, compared to Hold ratings for Revlon and Ulta. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance,"  JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock has lost approximately 20% of its market value since the turn of the year, which has come as a surprise to many considering the stock's high profile and historically low volatility. I believe that JPMorgan stock could soon recover; here's why. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with JPM. Click here to check it out.  JPM 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of JPM Peter Lynch Chart of JPM  Unjustified selloff The general market narrative is that big banks recently sold off due to a slowdown in the equity markets, credit losses in Russia and slower than anticipated interest rate hikes. Nonetheless, JPMorgan managed to beat its first-quarter revenue target by $318.51 million. From a quantitative risk vantage point, JPMorgan's recent drawdown is overdone. The company's historical monthly value-at-risk of 5% is 12.71%. This means that JPMorgan stock only draws down by more than 12.71% in a month 5% of the time. Even if the year-to-date slump in JPMorgan stock is warranted, quantitative evidence suggests that it almost never sustains a prolonged drawdown. Rising interest rates and operating activities Harvard Professor and ex-IMF economist Kenneth Rogoff believes the Federal Reserve will need to raise interest rates up to 5% to curb inflation back down to the 2% to 3% benchmark. The Federal Reserve looks set to embark on a series of interest rate hikes amid multi-decade high inflation numbers. Most stocks suffer during rising interest rate environments. However, banking stocks tend to correlate with rising interest rates as their interest-bearing activities find support. JPMorgan's interest-bearing activities make up 43% of its total revenue, and a rate hike could support the broader segment. Additionally, the bank's non-interest-bearing activities such as trading, wealth management and investment banking could also benefit from lower input costs. Valuation First off, let's examine a few style metrics. JPMorgan exhibits a good return on equity ratio (ROE) of 16.13%. Additionally, the ROE metric exceeds the stock's five-year average dividend growth ratio (14.99%), which suggests that the justified value is in check. Furthermore, JPMorgan's price-earnings ratio is trading at a normalized discount worth 26.39%, suggesting that the stock is yet to reach its cyclical peak. Finally, JPMorgan stock's price-book ratio of 1.43 could mean it's overvalued because banking stocks generally trade around their book value threshold (1.00). However, JPMorgan's price-book ratio is still at a normalized discount of 9.88%, and it needs to be considered that much of its assets could be trading above market value as the financial markets have been in a topsy-turvy period, leading to many assets being oversold. The bottom line I believe JPMorgan stock could be set to recover as a higher interest-rate environment coupled with robust operating activities could help the stock reach its fair value. JPMorgan is trading above its book value, but it needs to be considered that the company's assets may be undervalued after a trying time for financial markets.

""You're going to see cyclicals and more defensive names continue the rally after we get past this period of adjustment,"" said James Sullivan, head of Asia ex-Japan equity research at JPMorgan. Cyclical stocks are companies whose underlying businesses tend to follow the economic cycle of expansion and recession. Some of these include sectors such as finance, energy and industrial. Defensive stocks — such as health care and consumer staples — typically provide consistent earnings and dividends regardless of stock market conditions. Global stock markets wobbled in recent weeks as bond yields rose, driven by optimism in the vaccine rollout for Covid-19 and the resumption of consumption spending. The move fueled expectations of higher inflation and investors worried it would prompt central banks to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates can knock down stocks with relatively high valuations. Interest rates concerns also accelerated a market rotation — as investors took money out of expensive tech and growth stocks and put them into other cyclical sectors such as finance, energy and industrial. Stocks have rebounded in recent sessions but analysts still expect market conditions to remain volatile. ""What we've seen is a very, very sharp rebound in value, you're likely to see a bounce in growth as a result of the extremity of that market move,"" he said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia."" ""On a medium-to-long term basis, though, we still see cyclicals and defensives leading this market higher,"" Sullivan added. Steepening of the yield curve is positive for the overall profitability of large financial institutions, Sullivan explained, adding that the investment bank is overweight for both the banking and insurance sectors. Financial companies typically benefit from rising interest rates as it expands their profit margin. A steepening yield curve occurs when rates for longer dated bonds rise faster than interest rates for shorter dated bonds and typically indicates that investors expect rising inflation and stronger economic growth. JPMorgan is also positive on consumer stocks, according to Sullivan. ""We are seeing very strong consumption trends across the board,"" he said, adding the bank ""would be positive on both financials and consumer as a result."" As economies around the world reopen, consumption spending is expected to resume on the back of better growth prospects and stimulus measures. Overnight in the U.S., President Joe Biden signed a massive $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that will put cash into the hands of Americans. Technology stocks were a big beneficiary in the markets last year as the coronavirus pandemic knocked global growth off track due to lengthy lockdowns around the world. Investors and traders, who typically turn to less risky assets in order to weather the market volatility, poured money into tech and software stocks which benefited from the lockdown. ""Overall tech leadership of markets was taken to an extreme last year,"" Sullivan said, adding that despite some of the recent sell off in tech names, ""we are seeing valuations that are reasonably high."" JPMorgan's argument is that within the tech space, investors should rotate out of platform names and move into companies that sell software as a service and into the semiconductor space given the ongoing global chip shortage. ""We don't necessarily see the large platforms leading these markets higher for the rest of this year,"" Sullivan added. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

,"  Despite the continuing low interest rate environment, the financial sector is rebounding quickly, driven by a significant increase in financial transactions by businesses and individuals in the reopening economy. Established financial companies Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) is an established financial institution that provides a range of financial services to corporations, financial institutions, governments, and individuals worldwide. It operates through four segments—Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management, and Consumer & Wealth Management. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) is one of the largest financial services companies in the world. It operates in four segments: Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Banking, Commercial Banking, and Asset & Wealth Management. Despite the unabated low interest rate environment, most financial sector stocks have been rallying this year, with the reopening of economic activities driving the non-interest-generating components of their businesses. Even though benchmark interest rates are held near zero for now, the Fed has signaled two interest rate hikes as soon as late 2023, a year earlier than anticipated, and has raised its inflation forecast to 3.4%. This is good news for the financial sector because many financial stocks thrive with rising interest rates. According to Globe Newswire, the global financial services market is expected to grow at a 9.9% CAGR to hit $22.5 trillion this year. Consequently, GS and JPM are expected to deliver significant returns in the coming quarters. GS’ stock price has gained 77.5% over the past year, while JPM’s returned 61.8%. Also, GS’ 72.6% gains over the past nine months are significantly higher than JPM’s 48.3% returns. Furthermore, in terms of their past six months’ performance, GS is the clear winner with 23.7% gains versus JPM’s 11%. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out. Latest Developments On April 13, GS announced that it intended to expand its footprint in the U.K. by opening a new office in Birmingham. Richard Gnodde, the company’s CEO said, “Establishing a new office in Birmingham will diversify our U.K. footprint and give us access to a broad and deep talent pool in the local area. We see tremendous opportunity to enhance our U.K. presence and continue delivering for our global clients.” JPM announced on June 29, 2021, that it had entered an agreement to acquire OpenInvest, a leading financial technology company that helps financial professionals customize and report on values-based investments. This is expected to expand the company’s portfolio of products and services in the sustainable investing space. Recent Financial Results GS’ net revenue increased 102% year-over-year to $17.70 billion for its fiscal first quarter ended March 31, 2021. The company’s pre-tax earnings grew 518% year-over-year to $8.30 billion, while its EPS came in at $18.60, up 498% year-over-year. JPM’s net revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $33.12 billion for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021. Its net income grew 399% year-over-year to $14.30 billion. Its EPS came in at $4.50, up 477% year-over-year. Past and Expected Financial Performance GS’ revenue and EPS have grown at 14.7% and 56.1% CAGRs, respectively, over the past three years. Analysts expect GS’ revenue to increase 23.2% for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, and 13.7% in its fiscal year 2021. The company’s EPS is expected to grow 1,737.7% for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, and 83.8% in its fiscal year 2021. Its EPS is expected to grow at a 19.3% rate per annum over the next five years. In comparison, JPM’s revenue and EPS grew at CAGRs of 6.6% and 21.6%, respectively, over the past three years. The company’s revenue is expected to decrease 0.9% for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, and 1.6% in its fiscal year 2021. Its EPS is expected to grow 129.7% for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, and 48.6% in fiscal 2021. JPM’s EPS is expected to grow at a 3% rate per annum over the next five years. Profitability JPM’s trailing-12-month revenue is 2.30 times what GS generates. JPM is also more profitable, with a 34.24% net income margin compared to GS’ 29.33%. However, GS’ 15.64% and 1.26% respective ROE and ROA are higher than JPM’s 14.97% and 1.19%. Valuation In terms of forward non-GAAP PEG, JPM is currently trading at 1.13x, which is 140.4% higher than GS’ 0.47x. Moreover, JPM’s 11.35x forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is 44.6% higher than GS’ 7.85x.

Yahoo Finance,"  Now could be a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy Square stock (SQ) as it transforms into a financial services powerhouse, argues Muzuho analyst Dan Dolev. ""We believe Cash App may be en route to becoming the ultimate neo-bank and the money center bank of the future. This could make buying SQ analogous to buying J.P. Morgan in 1871,"" Dolev wrote in a new research note to clients. Dolev reiterated his Buy rating and $380 price target on Square. The company's stock currently trades at $238, up about 8% on the year, according to Yahoo Finance Plus data. At the heart of Dolev's call is Square evolving into the bank of the future via its Cash App, one that essentially becomes the financial hub for consumers. Currently, the Cash App offers payment services, stock trading and the ability to buy bitcoin. ""We view Cash App as the ultimate challenger bank. Our detailed build of potential products shows a clear path from Cash App's current $40-50 average revenue per user (ARPU) to $150-200 over the coming years by adding products that range from tax services, to insurance, to home equity lending"" Dolev said. Dolev expects Square to add products that range from tax services, to insurance, to home equity lending on the Cash App. In turn, the Cash App could turn into a true money-maker for Square...no pun intended. Continued Dolev, ""We believe that with 30 [million]-40 million active users, Cash App currently taps less than 10% of its potential user base. We estimate that the U.S. bank account TAM [total addressable market] is 400 [million]-500 million accounts. This implies more than 10x potential upside to its user base. Conservatively assuming Square reaches 15% penetration of the total U.S. bank account TAM (~70 million active users, up from 36 million in December 2020), coupled with ARPU [average revenue per user] of $175 (midpoint of $150-200), points to nearly $12 billion in medium term gross profit potential. This is ~6x above Cash App's 1Q21 gross profit run rate of ~$2 billion."" Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

Yahoo Finance,"  Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2021 and 2022 in the past seven days. Also, this leading integrated company’s stock price has surged 34% year to date compared with the industry’s rally of 18.1%. Currently, the stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The price of West Texas Intermediate crude, trading close to $60 per barrel mark, has improved significantly from the negative territory touched in April 2020. The momentum is likely to continue since the coronavirus vaccine rollout will possibly help the economy recover strongly this year, thereby aiding fuel demand. The rally in oil price has also been supported by OPEC+ (OPEC and its non-OPEC partners) since the cartel and its allies have extended production cut till April. Per the agreement reached on Mar 4, following a meeting between OPEC led by Saudi Arabia and Russia-led non-OPEC producers, majority of OPEC+ members decided to keep the output unchanged. Overall, the massive improvement in oil price is definitely a boon for ExxonMobil’s upstream operations. The company now plans to allocate 90% of its spending for adding resources in prolific oil and gas plays in Guyana, Brazil and the United States. Importantly, the company anticipates its investment to generate more than 30% return. While funding profitable projects, ExxonMobil is also planning to lower its debt load. The plans outlined by the company also include that through 2025 it will boost its earnings and cashflows, which will help to preserve and increase shareholder’s dividend. The integrated firm is also focusing strongly on lowering costs. In 2020, the company successfully reduced its cash operating expenses by 15%. In fact, by 2023-end, the company projects annual structural savings of $6 billion, as compared to 2019. Overall, in order to win investors’ favor, the company is now not focusing aggressively on oil and gas productions. Instead, it is putting prime emphasis on preserving capital for shareholders and also to lower costs. Another energy giant that has also decided to keep capital outlays in check, while preserving returns for stockholders is Chevron Corporation CVX. Notably, following poor returns from the energy sector over a long term, investors now prefer companies that are showing discipline regarding spending capital. Other prospective players in the energy space include Diamondback Energy, Inc. FANG and Matador Resources Company MTDR. Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Diamondback is likely to see earnings growth of 112.5% in 2021. Matador is likely to see earnings growth of 300% in 2021. If you’re looking for big gains, there couldn’t be a better time to get in on a young industry primed to skyrocket from $17.7 billion back in 2019 to an expected $73.6 billion by 2027. After a clean sweep of 6 election referendums in 5 states, pot is now legal in 36 states plus D.C. Federal legalization is expected soon and that could be a still greater bonanza for investors.

News From Shell & ExxonMobil Dominate Oil & Gas Stock Roundup,"  It was a week wherein oil prices hit the highest in seven years but natural gas futures pulled back after topping $6 for the first time since 2014.On the news front, European supermajor Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) issued an update on its upcoming Q3 earnings, while American biggie ExxonMobil XOM boosted its estimate of discovered recoverable resources from the Stabroek block offshore Guyana.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 4.6% to close at $79.35 per barrel, while natural gas prices fell 1% to end at $5.565 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). In particular, the oil market managed to maintain their forward momentum from the previous six weeks.Coming back to the week ended Oct 8, oil prices rose despite a bearish report from the Energy Information Administration (""EIA"") that showed a build in crude and gasoline inventories. Instead, energy investors chose to concentrate on the market’s robust fundamentals and a supportive macro backdrop.Crude supplies recently fell to their lowest levels since October 2018, with U.S. commercial stockpiles down more than 16% since mid-March. There is also a marked improvement in fuel demand on the back of rebounding road and airline travel.Meanwhile, natural gas finished down following a higher-than-expected increase in supplies and the prospect of less weather-related consumption. 1.  Royal Dutch Shell expects a negative impact to its third-quarter earnings and cash flows, following disruptions in U.S. Gulf of Mexico production after Hurricane Ida swept through the region. The company lost about $400 million in income when the storm forced it to shut down several Gulf facilities for days and weeks. On a positive note, the European supermajor expects the prevailing strong commodity price environment to significantly boost its ‘Integrated Gas’ results.Shell released a preliminary report for the July-September period wherein the Anglo-Dutch biggie informed that the performance of the firm’s trading division, which was instrumental in helping the supermajor partly cushion the impact of the coronavirus-induced oil price slump, is likely to be sequentially higher for the Integrated Gas division and “similar” to the Oil Products business.According to the latest update, Shell’s upstream production fell by 6.4% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter of 2021 at the midpoint of the guidance. Taking into account the storm-related outage of 90 oil-equivalent per day (MBOE/d), the supermajor is estimating its output in the range of 2,025 to 2,100 MBOE/d compared to 2,203 MBOE/d a year ago.

Yahoo Finance,"  Every investor in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership. With a market capitalization of US$250b, Exxon Mobil is rather large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors, too. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it seems that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about Exxon Mobil.  Check out our latest analysis for Exxon Mobil  Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. We can see that Exxon Mobil does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Exxon Mobil, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Exxon Mobil. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.3% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.0% by the third-largest shareholder. On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Exxon Mobil Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$382m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling.  The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 47% stake in Exxon Mobil. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Exxon Mobil .

Yahoo Finance,"  Shares of Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) increased by 28.23% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Exxon Mobil has. Exxon Mobil's Debt According to the Exxon Mobil's most recent balance sheet as reported on November 4, 2020, total debt is at $68.80 billion, with $46.89 billion in long-term debt and $21.91 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $8.83 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $59.97 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Exxon Mobil's $358.04 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.19. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

Yahoo Finance,"  Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) is not going to lower its dividend no matter what it costs the company. That point came out loud and clear from the company’s latest earnings conference call. This means that XOM stock will continue to have a “strong” dividend yield of about 6.15%. It’s worth at least 32% more, or $74.63 per share, based on its historical dividend yield. Source: Harry Green / Shutterstock.com For the past two years (8 quarters) Exxon has paid 87 cents per share in quarterly dividends. That works out to $3.48 per share each year. Exxon clearly intends to maintain that dividend. Therefore, at today’s price (April 9) of $55.87, the dividend yield is very healthy at 6.2%. Moreover, based on the company’s historical dividend yield, this is much higher than its average. For example, Morningstar reports that over the past 5 years, its trailing 5-year dividend yield has been 4.96% (almost 5%). InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips We can use this to estimate the normalized target value for XOM stock. For example, if we divide the dividend per share of $3.48 by the average yield of 4.96%, the result is a target price of $70.16 per share. This represents a potential gain of $14.29 or about 26% more based on today’s price of $55.87.  7 Infrastructure Stocks Excited For The $2 Trillion Biden Plan  We can do the same thing with the company’s earnings-per-share (EPS). Applying Morningstar’s 5-year avg. price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.62 times (over the last 5 years) to Exxon’s EPS for this year ($2.87) produces a target price of $73.53. That is over 30% above today’s price. Similarly using the Morningstar forward P/E average of 21.75 times Exxon’s $3.88 EPS for 2022 produces a target price of $84.39. Now we have three different price targets based on dividend yield and price-to-earnings. To round things out we can also derive a price based on its historical price-to-sales. Morningstar says this is 1.25 times over the last five years. Analysts predict sales of $245.5 billion for 2021, so the price target works out to $306.875 billion. This is 29.7% above Exxon’s existing market cap of $236.5 billion. In other words, XOM stock is worth nearly 30% more or $72.46 per share. That means that, on average, XOM stock is worth about 34% higher, or $75.14 per share. These ratios are based on earnings and sales estimates provided by Seeking Alpha on their Earnings tab for Exxon Mobil stock. The estimates can vary depending on which aggregation service is used. But this gives you an idea that XOM stock is undervalued based on its historical metrics. One thing to note is that although the $3.48 dividend exceeds the forecast earnings of $2.87 this year (2021). But next year analysts predict EPS of $3.88 per share, which will cover the dividend, assuming oil and gas prices stay high. Moreover, management said on the fourth-quarter 2020 conference call that cash flow from operations should cover the dividend payments this year. This coincides with their intention to maintain a “strong” dividend, mentioned 10 times on the conference call. Most analysts have higher price targets for Exxon stock, but not by much. For example, TipRanks.com says that 18 analysts have an average price target of just $60.68. Similarly, Yahoo! Finance says that 25 analysts believe on average XOM stock is worth $61.18. However, Marketbeat.com reports that 24 analysts have a lower target of $52.73, whereas Seeking Alpha says that 27 analysts have an average target of $61.36. Click to Enlarge Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA You can see in the table on the right that the median analyst price target is $60.63, or 7.1% above today’s price. So, on the one hand, this is much lower than my price target using historical metrics. But on the other hand, keep in mind that my price target could take several years to achieve, whereas most analysts are just looking out one year. For example, if my 34% higher price target takes two years, the average annual return will be just 16% each year on a compounded basis. Moreover, the dividend yield is 6.15%. Therefore the total return, even if the analysts’ target price pans out will be 13.25% (i.e., 7.1% price gain plus 6.15% dividend yield). My target price produces an expected return of 21.95% (i.e., 14.8% gain plus 6.15% yield). Any way that you look at it, XOM stock looks like a good bargain here, assuming oil stays high and the stock returns to its normal historical value metrics. On the date of publication, Mark R. Hake did not hold a long or short position in any of the securities in this article.

Yahoo Finance,"  Exxon Mobil, an American multinational oil and gas corporation, ended 2020 in a bad shape as the energy company reported a record annual loss in the wild year due to the COVID-19 pandemic-driven-slowdown that hurt energy prices and demand. Irving, Texas-based multinational oil and gas corporation said its fourth-quarter loss was $20.1 billion included unfavourable identified items of $20.2 billion, primarily non-cash impairments; earnings excluding identified items were $110 million, or $0.03 per share assuming dilution. That was a little better than the Wall Street consensus estimate of $0.01 per share. Last year, ExxonMobil reduced annual cash operating expenses by $8 billion, of which $3 billion are structural reductions. The Company expects to generate additional annual savings of $3 billion by 2023, resulting in total structural annual expense reductions of $6 billion, including savings from a global workforce reduction. “Exxon Mobil (XOM) guided to the low end of the capex range for 2021 but demonstrated at $50 Brent it could spend at the high end of its budget in 2021 and 2025. While positive on the surface, this could suggest XOM is unlikely to further reduce capex in outer years below its current budget. CCS could be a risk mitigation venture at a minimum and a commercial opportunity at best. Maintain Market Perform,” said Jason Gabelman, equity analyst at Cowen and company. Exxon Mobil shares, which plunged over 40% in 2020, closed 1.58% higher at $45.63 on Tuesday. Fifteen analysts who offered stock ratings for Exxon Mobil in the last three months forecast the average price in 12 months at $51.42 with a high forecast of $74.00 and a low forecast of $39.00. The average price target represents a 12.69% increase from the last price of $45.63. From those 15 analysts, six rated “Buy”, six rated “Hold”, and three rated “Sell”, according to Tipranks. Morgan Stanley gave a base target price of $57 with a high of $84 under a bull scenario and $22 under the worst-case scenario. The firm currently has an “Overweight” rating on the oil and gas company’s stock. “Lower ’21 spending, further capital plan flexibility, and incremental cost cuts increase FCF and dividend cover, supporting yield compression. A more proactive approach to low-carbon investments helps mitigate energy transition risks, while also offering new attractive growth options. Reiterate Overweight,” said Devin McDermott, equity and commodity analyst at Morgan Stanley. Several other analysts have also recently commented on the stock. UBS raised the price target to $48 from $45. HSBC upped the price objective to $52.5 from $49. JP Morgan upgraded Exxon Mobil from a “neutral” rating to an “overweight” rating and raised their price objective to $56 from $50. Cowen and company increased the stock price forecast to $48 from $36. In addition, Jefferies gave an underperform rating and price target of $39. Credit Suisse Group restated a “neutral” rating and issued a $52 price objective. Zacks Investment Research downgraded to a “hold” rating from a “strong-buy” and set a $51 target price. “Improving FCF outlook and dividend sustainability. With a more constructive commodity price outlook, lower capital spending, and potential for additional cash operating cost savings, the dividend is covered in 2021 and averages 100% over the next 5-years on our estimates. Improving dividend sustainability supports yield compression for Exxon Mobil (XOM) relative to CVX,” Morgan Stanley’s McDermott added. “Cost cuts defend the dividend. XOM reduced 2022-25 spending plans to $20-25 billion from $30-35 billion, improving dividend sustainability while limiting further pull on the balance sheet. Additionally, XOM is targeting a 15% reduction in cash operating costs, a level we expect it to exceed.” Risks to Upside: 1) Higher commodity prices, including liquefied natural gas (LNG). 2) Successful execution of major capital projects. 3) Permian well performance improvements. 4) Additional cost cuts -highlighted by Morgan Stanley. Risks to Downside: 1) Lower commodity prices. 2) Cost overruns on major capital projects. 3) Service cost inflation in the Permian erodes returns. 4) Geopolitical risk could impact production volumes and/or returns; Guyana is a particular focus now.

Yahoo Finance,"  Exxon Mobil shares rose nearly 2% in pre-market trading on Tuesday after the Irving Texas-based oil company reported the largest profit in seven years, thanks to higher energy prices and a waning pandemic. The U.S. largest publicly traded oil company reported fourth-quarter 2021 earnings of $8.9 billion, or $2.08 per share assuming dilution, resulting in full-year earnings of $23 billion, or $5.39 per share assuming dilution. That was well above the market expectations of $1.73 per share. This multi-fold rise in the fourth-quarter earnings was largely driven by higher energy prices. Supply shortages and political tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East pushed oil prices up on Monday, ending January at their highest level in a year. On Friday, the benchmark, Brent oil, reached their highest levels in over a year, reaching $91.70 and $88.84, respectively, marking their sixth straight weekly gain. This was their best performance since February 2021, up 17%, Reuters reported. Exxon Mobil’s board of directors approved the company’s corporate plan for 2022, with capital spending anticipated to be in the range of $21 billion to $24 billion. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the company announced share repurchases associated with the previously announced buyback program of up to $10 billion over the next 12 to 24 months. Following this, Exxon Mobil stock rose over 1.55% to $77.1 in pre-market trading on Tuesday. The stock rose over 24% so far this year after surging nearly 50% in 2021. “Improving FCF outlook and dividend sustainability. With a more constructive commodity price outlook, lower capital spending, and additional cash operating cost savings, the dividend is covered in 2021 and averages >100% over the next 5-years on our estimates. Improving dividend sustainability supports yield compression for Exxon Mobil (XOM) relative to CVX,” noted Devin McDermott, Equity Analyst And Commodities Strategist at Morgan Stanley. “Cost cuts defend the dividend. In 2020, Exxon Mobil (XOM) reduced 2022-25 spending plans to $20-25B from $30-35B (recently extended to 2027), improving dividend sustainability while limiting further pull on the balance sheet. Additionally, XOM is targeting $6B in structural operating cost reductions by 2023 which should put upward pressure on consensus FCF estimates.” Thirteen analysts who offered stock ratings for Exxon Mobil in the last three months forecast the average price in 12 months of $77.77 with a high forecast of $100.00 and a low forecast of $62.00. The average price target represents a 2.38% change from the last price of $75.96. Of those 13 analysts, six rated “Buy”, seven rated “Hold” while none rated “Sell”, according to Tipranks. Morgan Stanley gave the base target price of $95 with a high of $110 under a bull scenario and $48 under the worst-case scenario. The investment bank gave an “Overweight” rating on the integrated oil company’s stock. Several other analysts have also updated their stock outlook. Piper Sandler raised the target price to $85 from $79. Goldman Sachs lifted the target price to $84 from $71. HSBC increased the target price to $72.5 from $64. Truist Securities upped the target price to $70 from $65. Technical analysis suggests it is good to buy as 100-day Moving Average and 100-200-day MACD Oscillator signals a strong buying opportunity.

Yahoo Finance,"    Shares of Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) rose by 30.04% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Exxon Mobil has. Exxon Mobil's Debt According to the Exxon Mobil's most recent financial statement as reported on November 4, 2020, total debt is at $68.80 billion, with $46.89 billion in long-term debt and $21.91 billion in current debt.

Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Exxon Mobil has $358.04 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.19.
